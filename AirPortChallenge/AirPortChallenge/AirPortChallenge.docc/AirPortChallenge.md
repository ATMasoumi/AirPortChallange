# ``AirPortChallenge``

The purpose of this challenge is designing and developing an application representing a list of airports near a specified geo-coordinate given by the user.

## Overview

The application uses Amadeus: https://developers.amadeus.com/get-started/get-started-with-self-service-apis-335  as network source for APIs. Itâ€™s recommended to checkout the documentation for making API calls. You need to get an API KEY in order to call API services. (See Authorization guide : https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/apis-docs/guides/authorization-262 ) Turn on your VPN when sending API calls.


## Two screens:
A. First, getting a sample location coordinate (latitude and
longitude).
B. Second, showing a list of airports in radius of 1000 Km
consist of 20 items pagination per page.

## Items in the list should have the ability to be sorted by:
A. Relevance
B. Distance
C.Flights Score 
D.Travelers Score

## Each item on the list should have shown followings fields:
1. Name + City
2. Distance + Unit
3. IATA Code
4. TimeZone offset


One and only needed API is:
Base URL: test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/airports
